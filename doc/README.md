## Icon

The project icon is in the `icon/` directory (`icon.svg`). You can generate the images using `icon/icon-gen.sh`. To build with `icon-gen.sh`, you need to install docker in your environment to make use of the docker-based build script. To get started, run the following:

```console
sh icon/icon-gen.sh
```
